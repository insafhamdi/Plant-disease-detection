# Plant-disease-detection

Welcome to the repository for the project "Identification of Plant Leaf Diseases Using a 9-layer Deep Convolutional Neural Network". This project, aims to leverage deep learning techniques implemented in PyTorch to automatically identify various plant leaf diseases from images.

## About

This repository contains the dataset and potentially the code associated with the research project. The dataset comprises images representing 39 different classes of plant leaves and backgrounds, totaling 61,486 images. To enhance the dataset's diversity and improve model performance, we applied six different augmentation techniques:

- Image Flipping
- Gamma Correction
- Noise Injection
- PCA Color Augmentation
- Rotation
- Scaling

## PyTorch Implementation

The deep learning model for this project is implemented using PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework known for its flexibility and ease of use. PyTorch provides powerful tools for building and training deep neural networks, making it an excellent choice for this project.
